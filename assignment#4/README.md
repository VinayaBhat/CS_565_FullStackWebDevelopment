# Assignment 4 
 
 **All javascript code was implemented within <script> element in the HTML file**
 
 1. exercise1 prints `FizzBuzz` on numbers divisble by 3 and 5, prints 'Fizz` on numbers divisble by 3 and prints `Buzz` on numbers divisible by 5. All the other numbers from 1 to 100 are printed as it is in the console. 
 
 2. exercise2 reverses the number and prints it in the console. I take the modulo of the number by 10 and then divide the number by 10. The module operation gives me the last number and the divide operation removes the last number. Do this until number becomes 10. On each iteration multiple 10 by the existing result and add the remainder.
  
 3. exercise3 is the Bootstrap form. I added the javascript code to print the form input field contents on console on *Submit* action and reset the form input fields on *Reset* action.
 
 4. exercise4  prints the page dimensions *Width* and *Height* on page resize. 
 
 5. exercise5 is the button to change the color of the webpage. I have placed the button in the center of the page and the button changes color when hovered over it. On each click of the button the background of the page is changed to a randomly generated color (HexCode)
