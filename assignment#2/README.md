# Assignment 2

*I have implemented all styling using <style> tags within the HTML file.*

1. exercise1 is the HTML form with CSS styling. I have
- Centered the form in the middle of the webpage
- Used the linear gradient mentioned
- Whenever a button is hovered over it changes the color to green from navyblue.

2. exercise2 is the placekitten website. I have inspected the website and done the CSS styling. I have implemented the same colour and 
fonts used in the website. I have used 2 `div` elements, in the first `div` element we have the heading,text and one image and in the second '`div` element we have only the images.

3. exercise3 is the portfolio. I have used CSS flexbox to style this page. We have one main box which is the flexbox and two items called left box and right box. The left box conatins the profile picture. I decided crop the profile picture to fit in the circle. Also, I ended up using a different picture than what I used in the first assignment.
In the right box, I have added my name, information about myself, contact form and LinkedIn and Github links.
