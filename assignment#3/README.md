# Assignment 3

*I have implemented styling using <style> tags within the HTML file*

1. exercise1 is the HTML form which is implemeted and styled completely using Boostrap. I have kept each input field within a div element. Submit button is the primary button and Reset button is the secondary button.

3. exercise3 is **Layout 1** implemented using **CSS FlexBox**

4. exercise4 is **Layout 2**   implemeted using **Bootstrap grid**

7. exercise7 is **Layout 5** implemented using **CSS Grid**
