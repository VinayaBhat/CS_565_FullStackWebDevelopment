# Assignment 3

*I have implemented styling using <style> tags within the HTML file*

1. exercise1 is the HTML form which is implemeted and styled completely using Boostrap. I have kept each input field within a div element. Submit button is the primary button and Reset button is the secondary button.

2. exercise2 is implemented using Boostrap grid. I have used col-*number_of_cells* to specify the number of cells in the 12 column grid that the item will take up even on resizing the page from page xs upwards.

3. exercise3 is **Layout 1** implemented using **CSS FlexBox**
